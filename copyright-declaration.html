      <h1>Copyright & Licensing Declaration</h1>
      <p>
        By submitting a game to PastelReviews, you confirm and agree to the
        following:
      </p>
      <h2>Ownership of Content</h2>
      <p>
        I declare that I am the original creator of the game and its content,
        including but not limited to the game code, graphics, audio, characters,
        design, storyline, and any other intellectual property (IP) contained
        within the game. If any part of the game was developed in collaboration
        with others (such as freelancers or co-creators), I confirm that I have
        obtained all necessary rights and have legal agreements that assign or
        license ownership of the content to me.
      </p>
      <h2>Licensing & Copyright Law</h2>
      <p>
        I understand that copyright protection under UK law automatically
        applies to original works I have created, but does not apply to ideas or
        concepts. Therefore, only material that has been physically created is
        protected. I confirm that I am not infringing on the copyrights or
        trademarks of other games, companies, or media franchises, including but
        not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Existing characters, names, or likenesses</li>
        <li>Stories or worlds from films, books, or games</li>
        <li>Brand logos or titles</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If I have based my game on any existing intellectual property (IP), I
        confirm that I have secured a valid license or permission from the IP
        holder.
      </p>
      <h2>Third-Party Content</h2>
      <p>
        If my game includes third-party content (such as music, images, or
        code), I confirm that I have obtained the necessary licenses or
        permissions to use that content. I will provide proof of these licenses
        upon request.
      </p>

      <h2>Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        I understand that PastelReviews may rely on the information I have
        provided. If any part of this declaration is found to be false or
        misleading, I accept full responsibility and agree to indemnify
        PastelReviews for any legal or financial consequences, including but not
        limited to legal action, takedown notices, or publisher claims.
      </p>
      <h2>Content Moderation and Responsibility</h2>

      <p>
        PastelReviews respects intellectual property rights and is committed to
        maintaining a safe, respectful environment for all users. While we
        encourage creativity and the sharing of diverse gaming experiences, all
